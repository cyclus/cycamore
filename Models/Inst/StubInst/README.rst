This is a directory intended to hold InstModel templates. 

That is, it is intended to hold the skeletal stub modules for assistance with 
developing new concrete Institution Models for Cyclus. It also holds elements of a build

building and installation process. 

More information on institutions can be found `here <http://cyclus.github.com/devdoc/make-models/inst.html/>`.
