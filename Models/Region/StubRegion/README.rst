Region
=======

This is a directory intended to hold RegionModel templates. 

That is, it is intended to hold the skeletal stub modules for assistance with 
developing new concrete RegionModels for Cyclus. It also holds elements of a build 
system that facilitates building and installation in tandem with the Cyclus 
building and installation process. 

More information on regions can be found `here <http://cyclus.github.com/devdoc/make-models/region.html/>`.
