///
/// The FuelFab has 3 input inventories: fissile stream, filler stream, and an
/// optional top-up inventory.  All materials received into each inventory are
/// always combined into a single material (i.e. a single fissile material, a
/// single filler material, etc.).  The input streams and requested fuel
/// composition are each assigned weights based on summing:
///
///     N * (p_i - p_U238) / (p_Pu239 - p_U238)
///
/// for each nuclide where:
///
///     - p = nu*sigma_f - sigma_a   for the nuclide
///     - p_U238 is p for pure U238
///     - p_Pu239 is p for pure Pu239
///     - N is the nuclide's atom fraction
///     - nu is the average # neutrons per fission
///     - sigma_f is the microscopic fission cross-section
///     - sigma_a is the microscopic neutron absorption cross-section
///
/// The cross sections are from the simple cross section library in PyNE. They
/// can be set to either a thermal or fast neutron spectrum.  A linear
/// interpolation is performed using the weights of the fissile, filler, and
/// target streams. The interpolation is used to compute a mixing ratio of the
/// input streams that matches the target weight.  In the event that the target
/// weight is higher than the fissile stream weight, the FuelFab will attempt
/// to use the top-up and fissile input streams together instead of the fissile
/// and filler streams.  All supplied material will always have the same weight
/// as the requested material.
///
/// The supplying of mixed material is constrained by available inventory
/// quantities and a per time step throughput limit.  Requests for fuel
/// material larger than the throughput can never be met.  Fissile inventory
/// can be requested/received via one or more commodities.  The DRE request
/// preference for each of these commodities can also optionally be specified.
/// By default, the top-up inventory size is zero, and it is not used for
/// mixing.
