/// @class BatchReactor
///
/// @section introduction Introduction
/// The BatchReactor is a facility that models batch processing. It has three
/// storage areas which hold batches of materials: reserves, core, and
/// storage. Incoming material orders are placed into reserves, from which the
/// core is provided batches during refueling. When a process has been
/// completed, batches are moved from the core into storage. Requests for
/// material are bid upon based on the state of the material in storage.
///
/// The Reactor can manage multiple input-output commodity pairs, and keeps
/// track of the pair that each batch belongs to. Batches move through the
/// system independently of their input/output commodity types, but when batches
/// reach the storage area, they are offered as bids depedent on their output
/// commodity type.
///
/// @section params Parameters
/// A BatchReactor has the following tuneable parameters:
///   #. batch_size : the size of batches
///   #. n_batches : the number of batches that constitute a full core
///   #. process_time : the number of timesteps a batch process takes
///   #. n_load : the number of batches processed at any given time (i.e.,
///   n_load is unloaded and reloaded after a process is finished
///   #. n_reserves : the preferred number of batches in reserve
///   #. preorder_time : the amount of time before a process is finished to
///   order fuel
///   #. refuel_time : the number of timesteps required to reload the core after
///   a process has finished
/// 
/// The BatchReactor also maintains a cyclus::CommodityRecipeContext, which
/// allows it to track incommodity-inrecipe/outcommodity-outrecipe groupings.
/// 
/// @section operation Operation  
/// After a BatchReactor enters the simulation, it will begin processing its
/// first batch load on the Tick after its core has been filled.
/// 
/// It will maintain its "processing" state for process_time() time steps,
/// including the timestep on which it began. It will unload n_load() batches
/// from its core on the Tock of that time step. For example, if a reactor
/// begins its process at time 1 and has a process_time equal to 10, it will
/// unload batches on the Tock of time step 10.
/// 
/// Starting at the next time step, the reactor will attempt to refuel itself
/// from whatever batches exist in its reserves container (i.e, already-ordered
/// fuel). Assuming its core buffer has been refueled, it will wait reload_time
/// timesteps. On the tick of the following timestep, the process will begin
/// again. Using the previous example, assume that the refuel_time is equal to
/// two and that the core buffer has been refueled appropriately. The refueling
/// "phase" will begin on time step 11, and will end on the Tock of time step
/// 12. The process will begin again on time step 13 (analagous to its state
/// originally at time step 1).
/// 
/// @section end End of Life
/// If the current time step is equivalent to the facility's lifetime, the
/// reactor will move all material in its core to its storage containers.
///
/// @section requests Requests
/// A BatchReactor will make as many requests as it has possible input
/// commodities. It provides a constraint based on a total request amount
/// determined by its batch_size, n_load, and n_reserves parameters. The
/// n_reserves parameter allows modelers to order fuel in advance of when it is
/// needed. The fuel order size is batch_size * (n_load + n_reserves). These
/// requests are made if the current simulation time is less than or equal to
/// the reactor's current order_time(), which is determined by the ending time
/// of the current process less a look ahead time, the preorder_time().
///
/// A special case exists when the reactor first enters the simulation, where it
/// will order as much fuel as is needed to fill its full core.
/// 
/// @section bids Bids
/// A BatchReactor will bid on any request for any of its out_commodities, as
/// long as there is a positive quantity of material in its storage area
/// associated with that output commodity.
///
/// @section ics Initial Conditions
/// A BatchReactor can be deployed with any number of batches in its reserve,
/// core, and storage buffers. Recipes and commodities for each of these batch
/// groupings must be specified.
///
/// @todo add decommissioning behavior if material is still in storage
///
/// @warning preference time changing is based on *full simulation time*, not
/// relative time
/// @warning the reactor's commodity context *can not* current remove resources
/// reliably because of the implementation of ResourceBuff::PopQty()'s
/// implementation. Resource removal from the context requires pointer equality
/// in order to remove material, and PopQty will split resources, making new
/// pointers.
/// @warning the reactor uses a hackish way to input materials into its
/// reserves. See the AddBatches_ member function.
