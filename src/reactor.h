/// the core is instantaneously transmuted from its original fresh fuel
/// composition into its spent fuel form.
///
/// Each fuel is identified by a specific input commodity and has an associated
/// input recipe (nuclide composition), output recipe, output commidity, and
/// preference.  The preference identifies which input fuels are preferred when
/// requesting.  Changes in these preferences can be specified as a function of
/// time using the pref_change variables.  Changes in the input-output recipe
/// compositions can also be specified as a function of time using the
/// recipe_change variables.
///
/// The reactor treats fuel as individual assemblies that are never split,
/// combined or otherwise treated in any non-discrete way.  Fuel is requested
/// in full-or-nothing assembly sized quanta.  If real-world assembly modeling
/// is unnecessary, parameters can be adjusted (e.g. n_assem_core, assem_size,
/// n_assem_batch).  At the end of every cycle, a full batch is discharged from
/// the core consisting of n_assem_batch assemblies of assem_size kg. The
/// reactor also has a specifiable refueling time period following the end of
/// each cycle at the end of which it will resume operation on the next cycle
/// *if* it has enough fuel for a full core; otherwise it waits until it has
/// enough fresh fuel assemblies.
///
/// In addition to its core, the reactor has an on-hand fresh fuel inventory
/// and a spent fuel inventory whose capacities are specified by n_assem_fresh
/// and n_assem_spent respectively.  Each time step the reactor will attempt to
/// acquire enough fresh fuel to fill its fresh fuel inventory (and its core if
/// the core isn't currently full).  If the fresh fuel inventory has zero
/// capacity, fuel will be ordered just-in-time after the end of each
/// operational cycle before the next begins.  If the spent fuel inventory
/// becomes full, the reactor will halt operation at the end of the next cycle
/// until there is more room.  Each time step, the reactor will try to trade
/// away as much of its spent fuel inventory as possible.
///
/// When the reactor reaches the end of its lifetime, it will discharge all
/// material from its core and trade away all its spent fuel as quickly as
/// possible.  Full decommissioning will be delayed until all spent fuel is
/// gone.  If the reactor has a full core when it is decommissioned (i.e. is
/// mid-cycle) when the reactor is decommissioned, half (rounded up to nearest
/// int) of its assemblies are transmuted to their respective burnt
/// compositions.
