///   @class Sink
///   This cyclus::Facility requests a finite amount of its input commodity.
///  It offers nothing.
///
///  The Sink class inherits from the cyclus::Facility class and is
///  dynamically loaded by the Agent class when requested.
///
///  @section intro Introduction
///  The Sink is a facility type in *Cyclus* capable of accepting
///  a finite or infinite quantity of some commodity produced in the
///  simulation. A Sink requests an amount of that commodity from
///  the appropriate market. It then receives that commodity when the
///  market issues an order that the request has been matched with a
///  corresponding offer.
///  @section agentparams Agent Parameters
///  Sink behavior is comprehensively defined by the following
///  parameters:
///  - double capacity: The acceptance capacity of the facility (units
///  vary, but typically kg/month). Capacity is infinite if a positive
///  value is provided.
///  - int startDate: The date on which the facility begins to operate
///  (months). - int lifeTime: The length of time that the facility
///  operates (months). - std::string inCommod: The commodity type this
///  facility accepts.
///  @section optionalparams Optional Parameters
///  Sink behavior may also be specified with the following
///  optional parameters which have default values listed here.
///  - double capacityFactor: The ratio of actual acceptance capacity to
///  the rated acceptance capacity. Default is 1 (actual/rated).
///  - double AvailFactor: The percent of time the facility operates at
///  its capacity factor. Default is 100%.
///  - double capitalCost: The cost of constructing and commissioning this
///  facility. Default is 0 ($).
///  - double opCost: The annual cost of operation and maintenance of this
///  facility. Default is 0 ($/year).
///  - int constrTime: The number of months it takes to construct and
///  commission this facility. Default is 0 (months).
///  - int decomTime: The number of months it takes to deconstruct and
///  decommission this facility. Default is 0 (months).
///  - Inst* inst: The institution responsible for this facility.
///  - string name: A non-generic name for this facility.
///
///  @section detailed Detailed Behavior
///  @subsection finite If Finite Capacity:
///  The Sink starts operation when the simulation reaches the
///  month specified as the startDate. It immediately begins to request
///  the inCommod commodity type at the rate defined by the Sink
///  capacity. If a request is matched with an offer from another
///  facility, the Sink executes that order by adding that
///  quantity to its stocks. When the simulation time equals the startDate
///  plus the lifeTime, the facility ceases to operate.
///
///  @subsection infinite If Infinite Capacity:
///  The Sink starts operation when the simulation reaches the
///  month specified as the startDate. Each month the Sink
///  requests an infinite amount of the inCommod commodity from the
///  appropriate market. If there is a corresponding offer for that
///  commodity type from another facility, the Sink executes that
///  order by adding that quantity to its stocks. When the simulation time
///  equals the startDate plus the lifeTime, the facility ceases to
///  operate.
///  @subsection question Question:
///  What is the best way to allow requests of an infinite amount of
///  material on a market?
