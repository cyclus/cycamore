/// @class Storage
///
/// This Facility is intended to hold materials for a user specified
/// amount of time in order to model a storage facility with a certain
/// process time or holdup time.
/// The Storage class inherits from the Facility class and is
/// dynamically loaded by the Agent class when requested.
///
/// @section intro Introduction
/// This Agent was initially developed to support the fco code-to-code 
/// comparison.
/// It's very similar to the "NullFacility" of years 
/// past. Its purpose is to hold materials and release them only  
/// after some period of delay time.
///
/// @section agentparams Agent Parameters
/// in_commod is a string naming the commodity that this facility receives
/// out_commod is a string naming the commodity that in_commod is stocks into
/// process_time is the number of timesteps between receiving and offering
/// in_recipe (optional) describes the incoming resource by recipe
/// out_recipe (optional) describes the outgoing resource by recipe
/// 
/// @section optionalparams Optional Parameters
/// max_inv_size is the maximum capacity of the inventory storage
/// capacity is the maximum processing capacity per timestep
/// cost is the cost per kg to process the given materials
///
/// @section detailed Detailed Behaviour
/// 
/// Tick:
/// Nothing really happens on the tick. 
///
/// Tock:
/// On the tock, any material that has been waiting for long enough (delay 
/// time) is placed in the stocks buffer.
///
/// Any brand new inventory that was received in this timestep is placed into 
/// the processing queue to begin waiting. 
/// 
/// Making Requests:
/// This facility requests all of the in_commod that it can.
///
/// Receiving Resources:
/// Anything of the in_commod that is received by this facility goes into the 
/// inventory.
///
/// Making Offers:
/// Any stocks material in the stocks buffer is offered to the market.
///
/// Sending Resources:
/// Matched resources are sent immediately.
