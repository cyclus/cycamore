///
/// This Facility is intended to hold materials for a user specified
/// amount of time in order to model a storage facility with a certain
/// residence time or holdup time.
/// The Storage class inherits from the Facility class and is
/// dynamically loaded by the Agent class when requested.
///
/// @section intro Introduction
/// This Agent was initially developed to support the fco code-to-code
/// comparison.
/// It's very similar to the "NullFacility" of years
/// past. Its purpose is to hold materials and release them only
/// after some period of delay time.
///
/// @section agentparams Agent Parameters
/// in_commods is a vector of strings naming the commodities that this facility receives
/// out_commods is a string naming the commodity that in_commod is stocks into
/// residence_time is the minimum number of timesteps between receiving and offering
/// in_recipe (optional) describes the incoming resource by recipe
///
/// @section optionalparams Optional Parameters
/// max_inv_size is the maximum capacity of the inventory storage
/// throughput is the maximum processing capacity per timestep
///
/// @section detailed Detailed Behavior
///
/// Tick:
/// Nothing really happens on the tick
///
/// Tock:
/// On the tock, any material that has been waiting for long enough (delay
/// time) is placed in the stocks buffer.
///
/// Any brand new inventory that was received in this timestep is placed into
/// the processing queue to begin waiting
///
/// Making Requests:
/// This facility requests all of the in_commod that it can.
///
/// Receiving Resources:
/// Anything of the in_commod that is received by this facility goes into the
/// inventory.
///
/// Making Offers:
/// Any stocks material in the stocks buffer is offered to the market.
///
/// Sending Resources:
/// Matched resources are sent immediately
