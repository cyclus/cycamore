///   @class Foo
///   This cyclus::Facility provides a simple source of some capacity
///   (possibly infinite) of some commodity/Recipe.

///   The Foo class inherits from the cyclus::Facility class and is
///   dynamically loaded by the Agent class when requested.

///   @section introduction Introduction
///   The Foo is a facility type in Cyclus capable of providing
///   a finite or infinite.Supply of a particular material to the
///   simulation.  A Foo generates material of a certain
///   composition and commodity type, then offers that material on the
///   appropriate market. Shipments of this material are executed when the
///   market issues an order that the offer has been matched with a
///   request.

///   @section agentparams Agent Parameters
///   Foo behavior is comprehensively defined by the following
///   parameters:
///   -  double capacity: The production capacity of the facility (units
///   vary, but typically kg/month). Capacity is infinite if a negative
///   value is provided.
///   -  int startDate: The date on which the facility begins to operate
///   (months).
///   -  int lifeTime: The length of time that the facility operates
///   (months). -  std::string outCommod: the commodity that this facility
///   produces -  double inventorysize: the maximum quantity of material to
///   be held in the inventory
///   -  double commodprice: the price of the output material PER UNIT
///   -  map<Nucs, NumDens> outComp

///   @section optionalparams Optional Parameters
///   Foo behavior may also be specified with the following
///   optional parameters which have default values listed here.
///   -  double capacityFactor: The ratio of actual production capacity to
///   the rated production capacity. Default is 1 (actual/rated).
///   -  double availFactor: The percent of time the facility operates at
///   its capacity factor. Default is 100%.
///   -  double capitalCost: The cost of constructing and commissioning
///   this facility. Default is 0 ($).
///   -  double opCost: The annual cost of operation and maintenance of
///   this facility. Default is 0 ( $/year).
///   -  int constrTime: The number of months it takes to construct and
///   commission this facility. Default is 0 (months).
///   -  int decomTime: The number of months it takes to deconstruct and
///   decommission this facility. Default is 0 (months).
///   -  Inst* inst: The institution responsible for this facility.
///   -  string name: A non-generic name for this facility.

///   @section detailed Detailed Behavior
///   @subsection finite If Finite Capacity:
///   The Foo starts operation when the simulation reaches the
///   month specified as the startDate. It immediately begins to produce
///   material at the rate defined by its capacity. Each month the
///   Foo adds the amount it has produced to its inventory. It
///   then offers to the appropriate market exactly as much material as it
///   has in its inventory. If an offer is matched with a request, the
///   Foo executes that order by subtracting the quantity from
///   its inventory and sending that amount to the requesting facility.
///   When the simulation time equals the startDate plus the lifeTime, the
///   facility ceases to operate.
///   @subsection infinite If Infinite Capacity:
///   The Foo starts operation when the simulation reaches the
///   month specified as the startDate. Each month the Foo
///   offers an infinite amount of material to the appropriate market. If
///   there is a request for that material, the Foo executes
///   that order by sending that amount to the requesting facility. When
///   the simulation time equals the startDate plus the lifeTime, the
///   facility ceases to operate.

///   @subsection question Question:
///   What is the best way to allow offers of an infinite amount of
///   material on a market?
