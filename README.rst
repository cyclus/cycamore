Models
=======

This is a directory intended to hold models of 
various types. It mimics the installation hierarchy in cyclus. 

That is, it is intended to hold the skeletal stub modules for assistance with 
developing new concrete model for Cyclus. It also holds a build system that facilitates 
building and installation in tandem with the Cyclus building and installation 
process.
